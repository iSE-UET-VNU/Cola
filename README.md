# COLA: Leveraging Local and Global Relationships for Corrupted Label Detection     


## Introduction
COLA is a powerful, data-centric tool designed to detect and eliminate corrupted labels in real-world datasets. Leveraging both local neighborhood similarities and global relationships across the entire dataset, COLA identifies noisy labels that can significantly reduce model accuracy, especially in Machine Learning and Deep Learning models.

## The Architecture

![COLA-Appoarch](figs/COLA.png)

Figure illustrates the COLA approach, which consists of three main components: **Feature Representation**, **Local Verification**, and **Global Verification**. First, data instances are encoded using an embedding method to represent their features. In the Local Verification phase, the 𝑘-Nearest Neighbors (𝑘-NN) algorithm is employed to determine the labels of data based on their neighbors. Then, in the Global Verification phase, a classification model is trained on the "clean" data confirmed from the previous phase to capture general patterns and predict the remaining labels. This process can be iterated to improve accuracy.
